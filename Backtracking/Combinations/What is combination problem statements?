In mathematics and combinatorics, a combination refers to a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of selection 
does not matter. In other words, combinations are different from permutations in that permutations take into account 
the order of selection, while combinations do not.

Such us [a, b, c] = [b, a, c] = [c, a, b] are the same combinations, so they are considered as the duplicates.

In this section, we will see some problems related to combinations.
