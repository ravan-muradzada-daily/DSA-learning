Permutation problem is one of the most crucial problems which is related to backtracking. It helps to understand backtracking more deeply. 
Permutations are about arrays. 
That is possible all permutations of the array with the same elements with the same occurencies.
Like, imagine our main array is [1, 2, 3]. 
The permutations of that array are [1, 2, 3]; [1, 3, 2]; [2, 1, 3]; [2, 3, 1]; [3, 1, 2]; [3, 2, 1].

In the next problems we will be given array itself and wanted find all possible permutations of the array. 
(The given array versions will be different in the problems).
